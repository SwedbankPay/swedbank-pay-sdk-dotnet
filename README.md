[`SwedbankPay.Sdk`][nuget] is a library that allows you to interact with
[Swedbank Pay's API Platform][dev-portal] in a statically typed client targeting
[.NET Standard 2.0][netstandard]. For information about which runtimes (.NET
Framework, .NET Core, Mono, Xamarin, etc.) support .NET Standard 2.0, [see
Microsoft's documentation][netstandard-impl].

## Sample App

Check the [the samples folder][samples].
To run the sample site. Make sure to add your PayeeId and ApiBaseUrl from SwedbankPay in appsettings.json

You will also need to add the token from SwedbankPay in secrets.json by running the following command in the project root folder.
`dotnet user-secrets set "Token" "{Your token}" --project src/Samples/Sample.AspNetCore`

## Getting started

Install the [`SwedbankPay.Sdk` NuGet][nuget] in your project:

```shell
dotnet add package SwedbankPay.Sdk
```

To configure the SDK in one line using `Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection`,
you need to install `SwedbankPay.Sdk.Extensions`. The SDK can then be configured
as such:
(This requires that you have added `SwedbankPay.Sdk.Extensions`)

```csharp
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddSwedbankPayClient(ApiUrl, AuthenticationToken);
    ...
}
```

This will add the `ISwedbankPayClient` to the system, as well as interfaces for
all api's in case you want to have more control over what is injected.
See the [samples][samples] for inspiration and usage.
Using this to configure the `SwedbankPay.Sdk` will set up a
`LoggingDelegatingHandler` that aids in logging error responses from the api.
